## How to run it

This part will walk you through setting up the project. This set-up was performed on a Windows computer. 

0. Make sure you have added JavaFX to the project configurations.
1. Download the oopp-activities-bank zip from the activity bank on GitLab. Unzip it and copy the json file at the bottom of the map, then add it under 'server/src/main/resources'.
   It should now look like this: 
![img.png](img.png)
2. Now create a new directory at the same path named 'activitiesImages'. Copy into that directory the other folders contained in the activity bank map, these
   are numbered 00 - 78. This should be the result: 
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
3. Last step: Create a new directory under 'client/src/main/resources/images' named 'avatar'.
4. Now you should be good to go! Run the server and then the client, and the project should work! Try it yourself by running the following commands:
   - './gradlew bootRun' to run the server
   - './gradlew run' to run the client
